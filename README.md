# SimpleStockPrediction
This was a final project that I did in May 2021.

I used some simple machine learning techniques to take a stock of our choosing and predict its prices over the next 30 days.
Obviously this should not be used on the actual stock market, there are thousands of different things that can make a stock fluctuate.
In the file, I detailed every step and how it worked. Also I detailed why these things mattered and some theory behind them.
